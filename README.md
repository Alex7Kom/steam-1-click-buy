# Steam 1-Click Buy Button Beta

A userscript that adds a special button for each game in Steam Store, that allows you to buy it in one click using Steam Wallet funds.

## Installation

__Google Chrome__ and other Chromium browsers: Install [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo), then open Raw of the `steam-1-click-buy.user.js`.

__Mozilla Firefox__: Install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), then open Raw of the `steam-1-click-buy.user.js`.

Other browsers are not supported, and most likely will never be.

## TODO

* DLC batch purchase support
* Bundle purchase support
* Proper pre-order support
* Disable button if not logged in
* Option for re-enabling button for not refundable items
* Status dialog needs polishing
